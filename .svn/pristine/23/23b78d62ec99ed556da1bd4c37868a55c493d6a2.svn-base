' This script will demonstrate how one can use the HistoryState object to
' "undo" commands.  In this example, the HistoryState is stored, and then
' 2 methods are called simply to modify the HistoryState.  When the ActiveHistoryState
' is reset to the previously saved HistoryState, the actions are "rolled back" to that
' state.  This essentially does an "undo" of the 2 methods called.
